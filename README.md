[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/p8a/yara-java.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/p8a/yara-java)

Highlights
------------
- Does not require yara to be deployed (embeds all needed native dependencies)
- Supports two modes of operation:
  - External: yara binary extracted and executed as a child process
  - Embedded: yara jnilib runs embedded in the java process
- Rules can be loaded as strings, files or archives; for archives will recursively look for and load all yara rule files
- Matches are returned with identifier, metadata and tags
- Negate, timeout and limit supported


How to build
